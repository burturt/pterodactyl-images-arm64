# ARM64 Pterodactyl Images
Docker images created for ARM64 machines running Pterodactyl Minecraft servers. To use them simply change the docker image configuration field in the Pterodactyl panel to one of the image links. These images are largely based on images made by mathhewpi (https://github.com/matthewpi/images) and the pterodactyl team (https://github.com/pterodactyl/yolks)
